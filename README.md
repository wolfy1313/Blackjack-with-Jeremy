***
### ***Rules***
* The Pack
  * This game will be played using a 52-card deck
* Scoring
  * Each hand is worth 1 point.
    * Whoever wins gets the point, if there is no winner, the game is a draw.
  * An ace is worth 11 unless counting it as 11 would bring the total over 21, in which case it is counted as 1.
  * Face cards are 10 and any other card is it's pip value
  * "Naturals"
    * If a player's first cards are an ace and a card worth 10, this is a "Blackjack" and the player wins, provided the other's first cards are not also a natural which results in a tie.
* Dealer
  * If the total of the dealer's cards is 17 or more, the dealer will not take more cards.
  * If the total is 16 or under, the dealer must take a card.
  * If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand.
