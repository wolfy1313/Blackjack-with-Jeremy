My longtime friend [Blake Ball](https://www.linkedin.com/in/blake-ball-35845845/), who is a Senior Front End Engineer, walked through my code with me and helped me understand why some things were not working the way that I wanted them to. He also helped me understand that I could add an image to the card objects and then call that when I pushed the cards to the array.

Austin got me over the hump of accessing that image and pushing it as an img instead of a div. Thanks Austin!
